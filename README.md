Picky Eater
===========

Overview
--------

This app turns picking a restaurant into a game. The user picks a type of food they are interested in from a list of random categories. Then they are presented with a restaurant that matches their preference. If they don't like the offer, they can choose a hidden offer. However, the hidden offer can be anything from fast-food to an expensive restaurant, and once they opt for the hidden offer, the first offer is removed for good.
